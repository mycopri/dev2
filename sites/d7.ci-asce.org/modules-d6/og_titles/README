OG Titles

Organic Groups Titles is a simple module that allows you to create arbitrary member titles for each membership of a group.

Additional features have been added including configuration for select list-based titles. With select list-based titles you can also choose a sort order. With the old style the weight will remain null. 

Also, added permission for a user to access their own title.

NOTE: With these major changes you need to run 'update.php' to 6003,6004, and 6005! The update path does not add in weights.

Dependencies:

   * Organic groups (1.x or 2.x branches both work)
   * Organic groups views

Usage: 

   * Clone an og view such as og_members or og_members_block, and add in the member title field.  Or create your own 'member list' view.
      * You will need to add in >>OG TITLES<< relationship or the cloned view will not work. This is a non-trivial issue with Og's og_uid views data.
			* For each og_titles field, filter, or sort that you use, confirm that you do not use the relationship.
			* For each og_uid field, filter, or sort that you use, confirm that you >>DO<< use the relationship.
   * Group managers can manage member titles by going to og/users/%/titles where % is the group node id.
   * Users with permissions can access their title at og/manage/%/title
	    * Og Titles provides a view called 'og_my_titles' to replace Og's 'og_my' view. Please disable the latter.
   * Group managers can add/modify/delete titles from a list per group at node/%/titles
   * Site administrators can configure og titles behavior by going to admin/og/og_titles

That's it!


API:

   * You can define your own selection options besides 'select input' or 'text input'.

   * hook_ogt_type()
      * return an array of options in the form of
         * 'my_form_format' => translated title for my_form_format

   * Each type must have a form callback and a submit callback such as
      * my_form_format(&$form, &$form_state, $gid, $uid = NULL)
         * $form is the relative form element for a particular user's title.
         * no return value necessary
      * my_form_format_submit($gid, $uid, $title, &$form, &$form_state)
         * returns a boolean true or false whether or not you succeeded in committing the changes.
